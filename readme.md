# volatility_plugins

This repository contains some plugins I wrote while learning how to create plugins for volatility.

The majority of ideas will come from `SANS Institure` courses, and `The Art of Memory Forensics`, together with ideas for plugins I needed and could not find on the internet.

Usage
------

In order to invoke these plugin, they need to be download to your machine, then either put in apropriate volatility directory, or be used with volatility's `-p <PLUGINS_DIR>` / `--plugin-dirs <PLUGINS_DIR>` options.

Disclaimer
------
These plugins were written by me at a particular point in time. I don't guarantee that the plugins in this repository will be the compatible with the most recent version of Volatility, or that they report results accurately.
